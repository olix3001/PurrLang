# PurrLang :rocket:
PurrLang is a programming language that compiles to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) blocks.

This is very experimental and is not guaranteed to be supported in the future.

## Current progress:
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Type/Variable resolution (in progress)
- [ ] Code generation crate
- [ ] Compiler
- [ ] Optimizer
- [ ] CLI tool

### My notes for later programming :smile:
- Struct field offsets should be calculated in alphabetical order to
easily match between anon-struct and named-struct.
